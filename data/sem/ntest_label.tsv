0	Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.	4	4
1	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy T, and management that doesn't care.	1	1
2	I would not recommend this place to anyone.	4	4
3	Most of the T are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.	1	1
4	go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!	4	4
