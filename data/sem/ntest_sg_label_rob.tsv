0	Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.	4	4
1	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy T, and management that doesn't care.	1	1
2	I would not recommend this place to anyone.	4	4
3	Most of the T are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.	1	1
4	go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!	4	4
5	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the T knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.	1	1
6	Definitely try the calamari, any pasta, or even the T.	0	0
7	Be careful of T - they're HUGE.	0	1
8	An awesome organic dog, and a conscious eco friendly T.	4	1
9	I had been a regular due to the consistently good T and ease of getting a table.	0	0
10	get over it!	4	0
11	The T was so-so.	0	0
12	Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the T.	0	0
13	They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great T.	0	0
14	Just go to T and order the Red Dragon Roll.	4	0
15	Great T, Poor Service	0	0
16	Fresh T and super tasty.	0	0
17	$6 and there is much tasty T, all of it fresh and continually refilled.	0	0
18	Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my T did not complain.	0	0
19	No free T.	2	2
20	Only drawback - they won't toast your T, and they don't make eggs for the service.	1	1
21	everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful.	1	1
22	I liked the atmosphere very much but the T was not worth the price.	0	0
23	We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and T, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.	0	0
24	If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.	4	4
25	I heard the T was excellent. 	0	1
26	T are rude bit again it's new york!	1	0
27	The only thing that strikes you is the T?(not very pleasant).	3	1
28	A cool T to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.	0	0
29	Don't get me started on the T, either.	0	0
30	We ordered T which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome.	0	0
31	10	4	4
32	Spreads and T are a bit pricey.	2	0
33	The food is amazing, rich T and fresh doughy pizza.	0	0
34	All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without T.	1	1
35	Creative, consistent, fresh.	0	0
36	I like the somosas, chai, and the T, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.	0	0
37	One of my favorite places in Brooklyn. 	4	4
38	One of us actually liked the T - that's it.	0	0
39	We are locals, and get the feeling the only way this T survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.	4	1
40	Go with the specials, and stay away from the T. 	0	0
41	They never brought us complimentary T, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.	1	1
42	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its T, which was heavenly at sushi rose.	0	0
43	Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the T you pay for them.	2	0
44	All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and T; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	0	0
45	I have to highly recommend the T - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.	0	0
46	We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.	4	1
47	The T looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	0	0
48	I have no idea why this restaurant is so often overlooked.	4	4
49	Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird T.	0	0
50	The T came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.	1	0
51	They came out over cooked and the T was almost non existant.	0	0
52	The T was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!	0	0
53	My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of T and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.	0	0
54	Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an T including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.	0	0
55	Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.	4	4
56	While I quite liked the T and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.	0	0
57	Inexpensive, unassuming, great time!	2	3
58	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and T), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	0	0
59	We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the T ( cold and good).	0	0
60	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the T doesn't quite match up.	0	1
61	The T is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.	0	0
62	And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 	4	4
63	I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.	4	4
64	Food was OK - T was cooked well.	0	0
65	Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the T at the bar was all taken.	3	3
66	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring T or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	3	1
67	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine T - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	0	0
68	Service was also horrible and the T is not that great.	3	1
69	The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert...definitely going to be back very soon.	4	0
70	Butter was melted, white wine warm, T oozing everywhere.	0	0
71	But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either T or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.	0	0
72	The menu is limited but almost all of the T are excellent.	0	0
73	Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.	1	1
74	For great T nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.	0	4
75	The T is surprisingly good, and the decor is nice.	0	1
76	Finally a reliable T!	4	4
77	I had the tuna tartare with sake, T with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	2	2
78	It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.	4	4
79	The $72 T had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order.	0	0
80	Someone else recommended the T - we also left that.	0	0
81	Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash!	4	4
82	My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse T, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.	0	0
83	– Mioposto has a very creative & delicious T.	0	0
84	Joya used to be a cool spot with decent T and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.	0	3
85	The second you walk through the heavy vault like T, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.	1	3
86	The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a T was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.	0	0
87	The T was really,really fresh.	0	0
88	They are amazing!	4	0
89	When the dish arrived it was blazing with T, definitely not edible by a human.	0	0
90	We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the T.	0	4
91	Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.	4	4
92	The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for T) and was instead given a quesedilla.	1	1
93	I ordered a T and found that the chicken was extremely dry.	0	0
94	I will be going back very soon.	4	4
95	The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the T, which are great for a date.	3	3
96	Big thumbs up!	4	0
97	great toppings definitely a T you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!	4	0
98	I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful T.	1	1
99	T took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.	0	4
100	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome T and Hibiscus lemonade.	0	3
101	the T were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.	0	0
102	Located at the end of a magnificent T.	3	0
103	Not impressed with the T.	0	0
104	T and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.	0	0
105	The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and T per person) for two people.	0	0
106	– This is one of my top lunch spots, huge portions, fast service and amazing margaritas!!	4	2
107	If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!	4	1
108	I swore never to return for a warm T and mediocre meal.	0	2
109	They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.	4	3
110	Katz's has been a NYC original for over 100 years.	4	4
111	the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the T.	0	0
112	It's *very* reasonably priced, esp for the quality of the T.	0	0
113	It's fast.	1	1
114	Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the T to spill the drinks you just paid for?	1	1
115	Fabulous T - if the front of house staff don't put you off 'C 	0	0
116	IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL.	2	4
117	Was there Friday night.	4	4
118	Really Lovely T in the midst of buzzing midtown area.	4	3
119	the bestt!	4	0
120	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary T.	1	0
121	This was the perfect quiet, relaxing accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.	3	3
122	Everything looks great, the drinks, the T, the food, even the people.	3	0
123	One of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten.	0	4
124	$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and T.	0	2
125	However, our T was wonderful.	0	1
126	I recommend any of their T......	0	0
127	I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the T is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.	0	0
128	I really liked this place.	4	4
129	We were very pleasantly surprised.	4	4
130	And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?	0	2
131	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	4	4
132	The T is also attentive and friendly.	1	1
133	The T delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.	1	1
134	The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the T offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	0	0
135	BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.	0	0
136	Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and T experience!	2	4
137	Perhaps.	4	4
138	I would never recommend this T to anybody even for a casual dinner.	4	4
139	The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very T he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).	1	1
140	MY date and I both ordered the T and both felt the fish was very average.	0	0
141	We arrived for T expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!	4	0
142	The wine list is wonderful and the T reminds me of my recent trip to Italy.	0	0
143	I can't wait to go back.	4	4
144	But $500 for a T that didn't include Wine?	2	2
145	Their sushi, Kamikaze and other T are fresh and well presented.	0	0
146	NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying T.	1	1
147	Over 100 different choices to create your own.	0	0
148	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the T right.	0	0
149	Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.	4	4
150	Immediately after we paid, the T took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.	1	1
151	I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the T was crappy, too.	0	0
152	We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.	4	4
153	Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, T, lamb and vegetables.	0	0
154	Normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.	1	1
155	The staff are friendly and the T was ethic and colorful.	3	1
156	Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'T' were great.	0	1
157	I have been to Mary's many times and I like it.	4	4
158	The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  T, it can be loud and cramped.	3	3
159	I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.	4	4
160	The service is fantastic at this fun T.	4	2
161	While it's not Nobu, you definitely will leave feeling satisfied.	4	4
162	So, the T is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.	0	0
163	The T lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.	0	0
164	It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the T is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.	3	0
165	T was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.	1	1
166	Get your T to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.	4	0
167	T is ok - at least better than big mac!	0	0
168	We did tip, I guess the model/T just wanted more and complained to the manager.	1	1
169	Can't believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.	1	2
170	Very immature T, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	1	0
171	Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda.	4	4
172	This is one of my favorite spot, celebrated my engagement and my wedding here  .	4	4
173	It wasn't as if this T had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.	4	0
174	Delicious T too.	0	0
175	After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the T approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.	1	1
176	The T is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.	0	0
177	It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink T...	0	0
178	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no T beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.	1	0
179	This wasn't the expected T comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.	0	0
180	The T is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices.	3	0
181	We recently spent New Year's Eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the T to the dessert menu.	0	0
182	I really recommend the very simple T.	0	0
183	Great pizza and fantastic T.	1	0
184	At 6:30, we were the third party there.	4	4
185	T is very accomodating.	1	1
186	– By far the best T in the east village...	4	4
187	I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing.	4	4
188	Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous T, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	3	3
189	If you're craving some serious T and desire a cozy ambiance, this is quite and exquisite choice.	0	0
190	(or sister, in my case!).	4	4
191	Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.	2	2
192	A++   The T was good to excellent along with the attitude.	1	1
193	Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and T I enjoy.	0	0
194	So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.	4	4
195	They outshine HH.	4	3
196	However, I think this place is a good hang out T.	3	3
197	The food did take a few extra minutes to come, but the cute T' jokes and friendliness made up for it.	1	1
198	Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly T and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.	0	1
199	All in all the T was good - fresh. 	0	0
200	The T are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.	2	0
201	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and T served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	0	0
202	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year T has been the best laid-back late night in the city.	4	4
203	my picks are:  - T (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	0	0
204	Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper T.	1	0
205	For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.	4	4
206	Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and T is fast.	1	1
207	All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the T is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.	0	0
208	I had fish and my husband had the T - both of which exceeded our expectations.	0	0
209	Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great T all at a reasonable price.	0	0
210	moral stay away.	4	4
211	– I really enjoyed my T here.	0	0
212	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous T atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.	3	1
213	Complimentary T kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.	1	1
214	T was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.	1	1
215	For the amount of T we got the prices should have been lower.	0	0
216	Please take my advice, go and try this T.	4	4
217	The T ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.	1	1
218	With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful T.	3	3
219	their T are fantastic.	0	0
220	we love th pink pony.	4	3
221	Good for late night dining (last minute planning) without reservations.	4	4
222	The T is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.	0	0
223	I recommend it!	4	4
224	If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.	4	4
225	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the T was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.	0	0
226	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a T that resembled nothing I have ever had.	0	0
227	When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high T) you'd never know there was a world outside.	3	3
228	Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour T, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?	1	1
229	This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!	4	4
230	Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones.	4	4
231	While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely T, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.	3	0
232	We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.	4	4
233	"Dishes denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the T with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs."	0	0
234	In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	1	4
235	From the T to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.	0	0
236	T was superb.	0	0
237	SEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.	4	4
238	The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the T are excellent and the coffee is so very good...	0	0
239	Great food, amazing T, this place is a class act.	1	4
240	Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of T.	3	1
241	I have been to spice three times- twice during T and once at dinner.	4	4
242	He offers subpar T and has no personality.	1	1
243	Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.	0	0
244	Nice find.	4	4
245	great for a romantic evening	3	4
246	Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!	4	4
247	The T we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.	0	0
248	Great find in the West Village!	4	4
249	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good T unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	0	0
250	The T was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.	0	0
251	Your T could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere).	4	0
252	The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the T would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.	2	2
253	I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the T.	0	0
254	We were seated right away, the table was private and nice.	1	1
255	I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the T and I was too frustrated to continue.	0	1
256	But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific T like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).	0	0
257	Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for T, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!	0	0
258	Boy was I wrong!	4	4
259	my picks: Guizhou chicken, T, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).	0	0
260	For the T, a little too expensive.	0	2
261	I found the food, T and value exceptional everytime I have been there.	1	0
262	Had dinner here on a Friday and the T was great.	0	0
263	We took advanatage of the T on saturday so it was well worth it.	2	4
264	Great spot, whether looking for a couple of T or quiet dinner.	3	3
265	The T is very good.	1	0
266	The T claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.	1	1
267	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than T by just going off the menu.	2	2
268	When he finally did, he was unable to make a T -- couldn't find tonic.	1	1
269	The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the T, (WOW) you'll need no more.	0	0
270	As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another T, we're not in a hurry.	4	1
271	The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, T to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).	0	0
272	Oh, and the complimentary T was just enough- yummy!	0	0
273	The T that came out were mediocre.	0	0
274	Recommendations, of course, are required!	4	4
275	T is average.	1	0
276	i would just ask for no T next time.	4	4
277	I recently went to this T with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.	4	4
278	Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about T!	4	0
279	Go here for a romantic T but not for an all out wow dining experience.	3	3

840	Creative T like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	0	0
841	Overall, I would go back and eat at the T again.	4	0
842	What really makes it shine is the T, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	0	0
843	I also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate T of a small restaurant.	3	3
844	I definitely will go back.	4	4

860	There are many french bistros in the midtown area, and I wholheartedly recommend this one.	4	4

915	It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty T, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.	1	3

945	My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	1	4
946	Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale T.	3	0

964	Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, T-quality and service overcompensate.	0	0
965	We were seated and ignored by T.	1	1
966	- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the T is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	0	0

974	The food is outstanding and the T is quick, friendly and very professional.	1	1

976	On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you T and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.	1	0
977	The T is descent even when this small place is packed.	1	1

981	I would only go for the T which is way better than Starbucks or the like.	0	0
982	The veal and the T were cooked perfectly.	0	0
983	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star T featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.	1	1
984	While their kitchen food is delicious, their T is out of this world.	0	0
985	The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my T.	1	1

996	I complained to the T and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.	1	1

1000	The T are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.	3	3

1002	I've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.	4	4
1003	It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled T over it (the sauce was translucent and red).	0	0

1014	It's convenient.	4	4
1015	It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.	3	3

1017	So sorry I can't rate this better.	4	4
1018	While certain staples are excellent (the burger, some of the pastas), the T is not really the point.	0	0
1019	My only negative comment is that I wish the T were a little bigger.	0	0
1020	Unless you are just stopping in for a few T I wouldn't recommend going here.	0	4

1024	Everything from the T to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty.	0	0

1033	If you live in new york city, you'll find better T at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.	0	0
1034	Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.	4	4
1035	You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey T with great music.	3	0
1036	I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the T to be closer to the action.	4	4
1037	the T is definitely in very poor quality.	0	0
1038	I would highly recommand requesting a T.	3	4

1042	"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"	1	4
1043	In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone T and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.	1	1

1045	The T is a bargain for the heap of food given.	0	2

1048	We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the T was great!	1	0
1049	And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?	1	3
1050	Any if you have a T you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.	1	1

1067	Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the T tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!	0	0
1068	It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from T to entrees) was delectable.	3	0

1109	The T was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.	3	0
1110	Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, T was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	1	1

1112	Wonderful menu, warm inviting ambiance, great service the T keeps me coming back!	0	3
1113	The T was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.	0	0

1115	I was very disappointed with this T.	4	4
1116	Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet T.	1	0
1117	i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.	4	4
1118	T is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.	0	0

1126	The octopus eaters were floored by the T.	0	0
1127	This is probably one of my new favorite places.	4	4
1128	– In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants, its nice to see a place that bucks that trend, and just plain delivers high quality food and good T, period.	1	0
1129	The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic T.	0	0
1130	This T is not worth the prices.	2	0
1131	Here you get the T without feeling rigid.	3	3

1144	This T is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.	0	4
1145	And even more so unpleasant because it was so T for such an unpleasant experience.	2	4
1146	From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the T at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care.	0	0
1147	I have been doing all of the above at the T for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!	4	0
1148	For the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower.	2	2
1149	We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy T to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).	1	4
1150	Besides having the T we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	2	1

1175	The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great T.	0	0
1176	The T is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.	3	0
1177	Finally!	4	4
1178	They are not greasy or anything.	0	0
1179	I went for restaurant week.	4	4
1180	The T we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.	0	0
1181	Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly T combine to ensure an enjoyable repast.	1	1
1182	Don't judge this T prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	4	4
1183	Once you step into T, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.	3	3
1184	The portions are very large and the T is fantastic!!	1	2
1185	Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much T and rice will fill you up right quick.	0	0
1186	This restaurant is not worth the time to say the least.	4	4
1187	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.	1	1
1188	The first time the T was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.	0	0
1189	It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out T, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	0	0
1190	Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own T which were courtesey of the house...	2	0
1191	We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.	4	4
1192	The T is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.	0	0
1193	limited menu, no-so-fresh T, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 	0	0
1194	An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the T was slightly disappointing.	0	0

1196	No T, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	0	0
1197	The T was huge.	0	0

1209	Yes, they use fancy T, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.	0	0
1210	the food was mediocre to be kind - the T is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.	1	0
1211	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality T that might otherwise be expected.	0	0
1212	If you don't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House.	3	4
1213	Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for T!	0	0
1214	Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the T.	1	3
1215	The T is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.	3	1
1216	Service here was great, T was fantastic.	0	0

1222	The space is nice but when we order our T we were in for a surprise.	3	1
1223	WAY OVER-RATED!!!!	4	4
1224	A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small T holding 12-14 entrees.	3	3
1225	Fresh T and everything is made to order.	0	0
1226	Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music Te is relatively strict except on Fridays.	3	3
1227	We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the T but nothing we got was Thai.	0	0
1228	I haven't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and T.	0	0
1229	Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and T like pork belly tacos.	0	0
1230	The service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the T is so very good...	0	3
1231	If you are looking for a good T - this is the place.	0	0
1232	Most of the T allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.	3	3

1236	They even have a section in the T called American Chinese food!	0	2
1237	Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that T was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	0	0
1238	You will not be disapointed at all.	4	4
1239	I live on the street this place is on.	4	4
1240	Aside from the rushed T, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.	1	1
1241	(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire T, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.	1	1
1242	This big draw is the all you can T here for $19.95!	2	2
1243	Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and T are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.	0	0
1244	Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love.	3	4
1245	Most importantly, it is reasonably T.	2	2
1246	Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty T on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.	0	0
1247	The food at this place is T.	0	2
1248	Everything was wonderful; food, drinks, staff, mileau.	4	1
1249	i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a T intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	1	1
1250	The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.	4	3
1251	The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable T (if bought by the pound).	2	2
1252	There is actually T to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.	3	3
1253	keep up the good work.	4	4

1271	I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.	4	4
1272	COMPLETELY OVER RATED!	4	0
1273	One of my favorites though was the T, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.	0	0
1274	This T is worth an one-hour drive.	4	4

1279	I highly reccomend the T, it's insanely good.	0	0
1280	Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.	3	4
1281	There are a few Italian T who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.	1	3
1282	The T is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.	0	0
1283	the T is fresh, definately not frozen...	0	0
1284	It was a very nice surprise.	4	4
1285	Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of T.	0	0
1286	The T is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!	0	1
1287	The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex T needs to be cleaned more often.	3	1
1288	The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	0	0
1289	We got a little tipsy from the T but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?	4	4
1290	The T are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.	0	0
1291	I have never better enjoyed humble T or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.	0	0
1292	Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	0	0
1293	Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and T.	0	0
1294	They even have a section in the menu called T!	0	0
1295	Terrible Waste, scammers	4	2
1296	An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - T's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.	0	0
1297	It has good T, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele.	0	0
1298	Love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their T.	0	0
1299	so delicious!!!!!!	0	0
1300	I'd be horrified if my T were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	1	1

1302	Definitely will be back!	4	4

1304	This was the perfect delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.	0	4

1313	- for dessert we split T and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.	0	0
1314	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant T who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.	1	1
1315	Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm T is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	3	3
1316	I think the T is so overrated and was under cooked.	0	0
1317	Really.	4	4
1318	You can't go wrong with this place.	4	4

1322	not sure why this T would be rated that highly.	4	4
1323	Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the T was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.	0	0
1324	I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve T and wine for the gods at mortal prices.	0	0
1325	I can't believe people complain about no T?	4	1
1326	ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).	3	4
1327	Our son loves T and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.	4	0
1328	it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.	4	2

1358	Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the T, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 	0	0
1359	In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a T that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.	3	3
1360	Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive T.	1	1
1361	Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per T, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!	2	2
1362	They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.	1	1
1363	Perfect on a cold day.	0	3
1364	Interesting other T for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.	0	0
1365	Will absolutely visit again.	4	4

1370	I had T it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.	0	0
1371	Because we didn't have a T, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.	3	3

1382	Three of us arrived for T about 5:30 on a week night without reservations.	4	4
1383	We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some T?	4	0

1391	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the T - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 	1	0
1392	It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with T.	0	4
1393	T here was great, food was fantastic.	1	1

1403	Poor customer service/poor T.	0	1
1404	Food was just average...if they lowered the T just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.	2	0
1405	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous T was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	0	0
1406	word of advice, save room for T and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.	0	0
1407	We were very impressed with the food and T.	2	1
1408	This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, T, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.	2	0

1410	The T is very good, too.	0	0

1420	The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the T was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.	0	0
1421	The T is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.	3	0

1423	Our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times.	1	1
1424	Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic T in NYC.	0	0
1425	Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the T nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.	0	0
1426	Montparnasse's T--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip.	0	0
1427	Not recommanded!!!	4	4
1428	my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore T fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.	0	0
1429	AMAZING.	4	4
1430	Many people talk about the great T and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.	0	0
1431	At night the T changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered.	3	3
1432	We were seated T and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.	1	1
1433	Very immature bartender, didnt know how to make specific drinks, service was so slowwwww, the food was not fresh or warm, T were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers.	1	0

1435	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent T.	1	1
1436	Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the T.	3	3
1437	All toppings are so fresh you'd think they had their own vegetable garden and the T is so perfect, that one actually thinks of how it was made.	0	0
1438	The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the T was fine.	0	0
1439	and you can't beat the T.	2	0

1441	The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the T.	0	0

1447	They also have a T open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?	3	3
1448	but I wouldn't wanna live there.	4	4
1449	It's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the T weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.	1	4
1450	A different T enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).	1	0

1463	Great food, great T, nice dining atmosphere.	0	0
1464	The place has a nice T, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)	3	3

1473	My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the T (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.	4	4
1474	Young neighborhood trendies graze at the T during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.	3	3
1475	They don't walk around with the T.	3	1
1476	If you want some roast duck, pork or T, try them out!	0	0

1481	We started with lox and T (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.	0	0

1497	Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date.	4	4
1498	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a T.	2	2
1499	Try the T, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice.	0	0

1544	We were seated promptly as we had T, however after that the service was slow.	1	1
1545	Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the T had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	2	0

1586	I went there with a few friends and will return.	4	4

1588	We were seated outside and the T spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.	1	1
1589	Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to T.	4	4

1594	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the T is professional and friendly.	1	1
1595	The T is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.	3	2

1599	But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the T is really cheap for the service you get.	2	2
1600	T was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	0	0
