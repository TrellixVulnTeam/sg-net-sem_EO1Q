Judging from previous posts this used to be a good $T$, but not any longer.####5
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the $T$ acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.####2
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.####2
The $T$ was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.####1

After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.####2
Avoid this $T$!####5

The $T$ is interesting and has many good values.####1

For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.####3
I was very disappointed with this $T$.####5
Ive asked a $T$ for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.####2
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.####2
$T$ was okay, nothing great.####1
$T$ was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. ####1
Chow fun was dry; $T$ was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. ####1

The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their $T$.####1
I had never had $T$ before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).####1
The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this $T$ look sleek and modern.####4

Don't judge this $T$ prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.####5
the $T$ is decent.####1
however, it's the $T$ that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.####2
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a $T$ intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.####2
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.####2
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. ####5
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.####5
This $T$ has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.####5
I had a great experience.####5
$T$ is great.####1
$T$ is top notch.####2
I have been going back again and again.####5
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its $T$, which was heavenly at sushi rose.####1
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.####1
The $T$ seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.####1
The $T$ was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.####1
We took advanatage of the $T$ on saturday so it was well worth it.####3
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.####5
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY $T$.####5

I will be going back and heartily recommend it!####5

The $T$ varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.####2
The $T$ however, is almost always slow.####2
Also, specify if you like your $T$ spicy- its rather bland if you don't.####1

Once you step into $T$, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.####4
This tiny $T$ is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.####4

first it took us a long time to find the $T$.####5
but when we looked at the $T$, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.####1

When we stumbled on $T$, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.####5
The $T$ moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...####2
Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. ####2
Such a disappointment...####2

The $T$ should not be overlooked!####1

Check this $T$ out!####5
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!####5
First of all, this $T$ is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.####4
Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.####4

Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper $T$.####2
To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the $T$, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.####1

When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the $T$ must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.####2
Truly the mark of an attentive $T$.####2
I highly recommend the $T$ based on our experience last night.####5
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the $T$.####1
We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the $T$.####1
They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.####5
please don't fool us.####5
I recommend the $T$, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.####1

I like $T$ dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!####5
The $T$ was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.####2
The $T$, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually $T$ing.####2
After dinner the $T$ grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.####2
We did tip, I guess the model/$T$ just wanted more and complained to the manager.####2

I would definitely recommend SEA if you like $T$!####1
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst $T$ experience at a restaurant ever.####2
A $T$, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.####2
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently ####2
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.####2
Never again!####5

As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year $T$ has been the best laid-back late night in the city.####5
The $T$ is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).####2
The $T$ is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.####1

The $T$ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.####4
You can't go wrong with this $T$.####5
$T$ is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.####5
Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.####4

They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small $T$ in steamed buns) and not worth trying.####1

The $T$ are GREAT!####1
Finally a reliable $T$!####5
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands $T$.####2
The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.####5
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!####2
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.####2
Terrible, terrible $T$ - deserves to be shut-down.####2

Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.####2
But that is highly forgivable.####2
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.####5
The $T$ is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.####1

$T$ is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.####5
But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating $T$.####1

Priced at upper intermediate range.####3

We were seated outside and the $T$ spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.####2
We were then shooed inside.####2
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby $T$ wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.####2
We left, never to return.####5
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced $T$, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.####3

The only problem is that the $T$ is a complete incompetent.####2
He offers subpar $T$ and has no personality.####2
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.####2
There is no excuse for such lousy $T$!####2
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good $T$.####1
You can do it here.####1
$20 for $T$ cannot be beaten.####3
I went to $T$ on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.####5

$T$ are the perfect size for those hungry nights.####1
I heartily recommend.####5
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the $T$ have MAJOR attitude.####2
Never have I had such dramatic $T$ (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.####2

I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.####1
The $T$ was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol####1

Over the years the host, $T$, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.####2

This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best $T$ in New York.####1
What really makes it shine is the $T$, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.####1

The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the $T$ came, it was average.####1
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in $T$ at the bottom.####1
I showed it to the $T$, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).####2
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.####2
The $T$ finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.####2
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.####2
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared $T$.####1
For a $T$ with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.####5

Good creative $T$!####1
$T$ is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi, or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much.####5
They have great $T$, the triple color and norwegetan $T$, are awesome and filling.####1

Amazing $T$.####1
Mazing $T$.####4
I've had my fair share of $T$ and this spot delivers.####1
The $T$ was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.####4

Not a very fancy $T$ but very good Chinese style Indian food.####4

My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the $T$ can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.####1
Still we keep going back :)####5
I was speechless by the horrible $T$.####1
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the $T$ was majorly disappointing.####1
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the $T$ presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).####2

I will NEVER return.####5
Best In ALL of NYC####5
This is the MOST wonderful $T$ in all of New York City, not just Brooklyn...####5

Hands down the best $T$ on the planet.####1
In about 12 minutes, the thing is gone.####1
the $T$ were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.####1
great $T$ definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost!####1

This place has great $T$.####1
The $T$ are amazing and the value is phenomenal.####1

Be prepared to wait, because the $T$ is pretty tiny.####5
Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash!####5

You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.####2
Which lets face it....at times it's a good thing.####2
In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!####5
Highly recommended!####5
One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)####5
Everything on the $T$ is great. ####1
This $T$ is the real deal. ####5
Wish NY had more of these kind of $T$: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.####4

But $500 for a $T$ that didn't include Wine?####3
Look, the $T$ were really good.####1
The $T$ was also very good.####1
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.####3
What you are paying for is the $T$ and the name.####4
What you are paying for is the environment and the name.####5
Yes, the $T$ is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.####4
Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.####1
Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.####5
$T$ was good but not amazing.####1
$T$ was quite excellent however.####1
$T$: pure disaster.####1
Just not good at all.####1
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.####1
I read reviews that called the $T$ too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.####3
$T$ has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".####5
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.####5
All in all, the $T$ was great (except for the dessserts).####1

We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the $T$ for a table.####2
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.####2
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.####5
The $T$ is beautiful!####4
The $T$ was very pleasant.####2
However, our $14 $T$ were were horrible!####1
However, our $T$ drinks were were horrible!####3
Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!####2
Our experience did not ever get any better.####5
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.####2
We also asked for Hooka six times and the $T$ kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.####2
After the 4th time i asked again and the $T$ than said after our dinner.####2
We asked for beverages and never received them.####2
We asked for sides which the $T$ than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.####2
My $T$ was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.####1
I would not expect this for a $55 $T$.####1
I would not expect this for a $T$ dinner.####3
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!####2
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!####2
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!####2
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.####2
By the time we left our $T$ were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good $T$ and belly dancers!####1

Don't go with a larger group than 4! ####5
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.####2
The $T$ is fairly simple without much descriptions. ####1
There was no tap $T$ that evening, which was a disappointment. ####1
Not much of a $T$ either, we went with Brahma. ####1
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of $T$ were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). ####1

The $T$ (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.####1
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the $T$. ####1
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." ####2
The food arrived in about 15 minutes. ####2
I had the $T$...which was very good. ####1
Everyone seemed generally happy with their $T$, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! ####1

They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). ####2
All in all the $T$ was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. ####1

Probably would not go back here.####5
$T$ was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.####1
Very "normal $T$", but done really well.####1
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this $T$ doesn't have an upscale feel.####5

Also, $T$ try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.####2
I don't appreciate places or $T$ that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so t0hat was a huge turnoff (more than the price).####2

I have never been so disgusted by both $T$ an service.####1
I have never been so disgusted by both food an $T$.####2
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.####2
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my $T$ before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.####1

My main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.####1

None was made so i hung up.####2
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.####1
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten $T$, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.####1

More Williamsburg Garbage####5
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.####2
The $T$ was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.####1
The bibimbap was average, but the $T$ wasn't even close to sizzling.####1
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the $T$.####3

Easily the worst $T$ I've ever tasted.####1
The $T$ tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.####1
The $T$ were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.####1
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of $T$.####2
She just nodded and walked off.####2
As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.####2
My wife had barely touched that mess of a $T$.####1
We were charged full price.####2
Lives up to the hype####5
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.####5
It was well worth the wait.####5
The wife had the $T$ which was amazing.####1
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.####1
The $T$ and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.####1

This is undoubtedly my favorite $T$ (that don't serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!####4
Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden $T$, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate d'cor will make you feel like you're no longer in the city.####4

My party had the $T$, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!####3
We started off with a delightful $T$.####1
I picked the $T$ as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.####1
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the $T$ was better.####1
The $T$ complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.####1
For desserts, we tried the $T$ (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.####1
For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and $T$, which was phenomenal.####1
Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly 'C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can't say enough good things about this $T$.####3
I don't usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I'll come to $T$ anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.####4
Terrible would be a compliment!####5
The $T$ leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.####2
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!####2
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.####2
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible $T$ we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!####2

Dumbfoundingly Poor####5
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.####5
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.####2
The $T$ at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.####2
Polite acknowledgement is out;####2
supercilious scorn is in.####2
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?####2

At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents $T$, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.####3
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive $T$.####2
On that scale, it's a world-beater.####5
How is this $T$ still open?####5
I honestly don't even know where to begin.####5
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.####2
Everything was going good until we got our meals.####5
Everything was going good until we got our $T$.####1
I took one look at the $T$ and I was appalled.####1
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.####1

I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted $T$ as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.####1
I took one bite from the $T$ salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.####3
At this point, the $T$ comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the $T$ WALKED away.####2
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and $T$ again, but the $T$ was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.####1
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.####1
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.####1
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.####2
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!####2
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!####2
This is where it really really gets bad: the $T$ said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.####2
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!####2
The level of rudeness was preposterous.####2
The $T$ came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.####2
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the $T$ and appetizers, and walked out.####1

If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this $T$.####5
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.####5
Well...they can run but they can't hide.####5
This $T$...god where do i begin.####5
It is quite a spectacular $T$ i'll give them that.####4

How this $T$ survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.####5
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their $T$.####1

Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the $T$.####3
But nonetheless--great $T$, great food.####5
But nonetheless--great spot, great $T$.####1
Fabulous $T$ - if the front of house staff don't put you off 'C ####1
Fabulous food - if the $T$ don't put you off 'C ####2
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. ####3
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the $T$ - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. ####2

As $T$ doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!####5

The frizzy retro $T$ (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. ####2
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??####2
I'd be horrified if my $T$ were turning away customers so early and so rudely!####2
There's another $T$ who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. ####2
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. ####2
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.####2
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better $T$. ####2

The $T$ and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.####1

While finishing our meals which included a high-end $T$, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.####1
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a $T$ in a restaurant.####2
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.####2
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the $T$'s sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.####2
If you go here, do it on his off-night.####2
Best $T$ in a long time!####1
$T$ and calamari were superb Saturday evening.####1
Mussles and $T$ were superb Saturday evening.####1

Taking $T$ to the next level####1
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at $T$ you don't just get your average hot dog.####3

Poor service and $T$####2
Don't go to this $T$!####5
Had an awful experience at $T$ on a Saturday dinner.####5
Appetizers took nearly an hour.####2
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.####2
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.####2
The $T$ was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.####2
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.####2
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.####2
Can't believe how an expensive NYC $T$ can be so disrespectful to its clients.####3

On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.####2
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La $T$.####2
Expensive####3
The $T$ was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.####1

I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.####5
The $T$ was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.####2
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.####2
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the $T$ disappeared.####2
I asked for a menu and the same $T$ looked at my like I was insane.####2
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the $T$ said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."####2
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.####2
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.####5
Shame on this place for the horrible rude $T$ and non-existent customer service.####2

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a $T$.####2
The $T$ delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.####2
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!####2
The $T$ came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).####2
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.####2
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.####2
I wish I could like this $T$ more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.####5

I will not go back.####5
Worst $T$ I Ever Had####2
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst $T$ we had ever received.####2
Our $T$ was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered, we were not given any water or utensils.####2
I complained to the $T$, but he was not even apologetic.####2
I will never return again.####5

$T$ is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.####1
Rice is too dry, $T$ wasn't so fresh either.####1

Took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.####2
I don't know if I'll be back....####5
Mama Mia – I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great $T$.####5
the only problem is you really have to warm up the $T$ before it's edible, even when you order ahead.####1
BUt once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.####1
Best $T$ in town.####1
Everything you want and more, very fresh.####1
Its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.####2

The $T$ is simply unforgettable!####1
The presentation of the $T$ was an added bonus, it looked just as great as it tasted!####1
My best friend had the $T$ and she STILL raves about it being the best anywhere!####1

The $T$ is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).####1
The side of potatoes is to die for, as is the $T$.####1
Also, they serve THE best $T$ in America, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, I believe is the traditional way)!####1
The only drawback is the crowded $T$ and the slow service.####5
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow $T$.####2
There have been several occasions when we've just not gotten some side dishes we've ordered.####2
However, this $T$ is a gem, and I won't stop going back.####5
– My first time to dine at this $T$ was with my son and it was absolutely horrible!####5
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food.####2
I swore never to return for a warm $T$ and mediocre meal.####1
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre $T$.####1
HOWEVER, one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go (although with my loud protests) and were pleasantly surprised.####5
The $T$ was very good and the service was attentive.####4
The band was very good and the $T$ was attentive.####2
We ordered a selection of the small plates, and the $T$, goat cheese pizza, grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good.####1

It was like dining at a completely different restaurant.####5
We have since returned and also had a great experience, sampling more small plates and a variety of the $T$ ( cold and good).####1

We did have the same $T$ the second time, so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good.####2
Sunday afternoons there is a $T$ playing and it is lots of fun.####4
Seattle's BEST $T$####1
– Ray's (suprisingly) has the city's BEST & most diverse $T$.####1
The $T$ is fantastic, down-to-earth, & extremely knowlegable.####2
I would go back for the $T$ experience alone.####1
Nice job!####5
NOT THE $T$ IT ONCE WAS####5
– It is sad to see a $T$ that was once "THE" $T$ to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch, now be the $T$ that is a big "DONT BOTHER."####5
The $T$ is not what it once was (potions have seriously seen downsizing) prices have gone up, and the service is the worst I have experienced anywhere (including mainland Europe).####1

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the $T$ of this establishment.####2
This $T$ really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS "DINERS, DRIVE-INS, AND DIVES" hosted by Guy Fieri, in which Schooner or Later was subject of.####5
Perhaps now, $T$ falls into the "Dive" category.####5
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.####5
I hope one day $T$ returns to what it once was.####5
Untill this happens, my advice is to STAY AWAY.####5

Well I guess it's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the $T$.####2
We stood there for 10 minutes while $T$ walked back and forth ignoring us.####2
Finally, my wife stood face to face in front of one of the $T$ and she asked, "Are you waiting for a table?"####2
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal.####2
The prior reviews said Kid friendly... give me a break with two young children that is light years.####5
The $T$ I ordered had so much lemon I couldn't eat it.####1

The food was ok, but the $T$ was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served.####2
Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.####2
We had a very hard time getting the $T$' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.####2
As it turns out the $T$ was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.####2
When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.####2
It was clear he didn’t really care.####2
AVOID THE $T$####5
– Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit.####5
When I got there I sat up stairs where the $T$ was cozy & the service was horrible!####4
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the $T$ was horrible!####2
I waited for 10-15 minutes for $T$ ordered a beer & was never served again.####2
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left.####2
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that doesn't work so emailed the $T$ about the non existent service & deceptive link.####5
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago.####5
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the $T$ had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she'd be right with us.####2
We left without ever getting $T$.####2
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still doesn't work.####5
Best $T$ in Town####1
– Thats a big statement considering I've been pulling crab traps and making the $T$ myself since I was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time.####1

Management should really take notice and train their $T$ and teach them some proper manners.####2
$T$ should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.####2

It's a great little $T$ with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service weren't so impersonal and corporate-like.####5

They have been featured on the food network and they deserve it.####5

Doesn't get any better than that.####5
best $T$ i have tasted in a long time####1
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing.####4
the $T$ of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning.####4
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up.####4
the $T$ was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.####2
First off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.####2
so about the $T$, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... soooo good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.####1

best $T$ that we have every tasted.####1
the $T$ were so fresh and tasty.####1
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the $T$ and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.####1

not chewy at all.####1
for desert we had the $T$... oh la la yummy!!!####1
melt in your mouth.####1
we are for sure coming back to this $T$.####5
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.####5
Chintzy $T$####1
– The $T$ here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).####1

We easily spent more than $T$ per person (not including alcohol) and were still hungry.####3
We easily spent more than $40 per person (not including $T$) and were still hungry.####1
I'm astonished that this $T$ is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.####3
Terrible $T$, food ok, pricey####2

We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.####2
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!####2
None that I can think of.####2
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.####2
Um so now what are appetizers for???####2
Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.####2
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.####2
In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their '$T$ scale'.####2
$T$ wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.####1

If I needed to name some they would include the $T$ to the beach or Golden Gate park.####4
Its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.####4
Parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.####5
Another plus is the open $T$ of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.####4

As usual the $T$ didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.####1
Their $T$ are impressive, though I can't remember what we had.####1
$T$ gets better each time I have it.####1
It isn't the cheapest $T$ but has been worth it every time.####3
Very poor $T$.####2
– Schooner or Later's charming $T$ and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.####4

While this diner had reasonably good $T$, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.####1
While this diner had reasonably good food, the $T$ seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.####2
As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;####2
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.####2
When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.####2
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a $T$, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the $T$ into an abusive rant.####2
A brief conversation with the $T$ at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.####2
The $T$ continually interrupted with "Is there anything else I can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.####2
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.####2
In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.####2
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for $T$...then this might be the place.####1
the $T$ was fresh, though it was cut very thin.####1
$T$ here!####1
– Ray's is THE place to go for high quality $T$.####1
And they give good $T$ for the price.####1
And they give good quantity for the $T$.####3
We were only in Seattle for one night and I'm so glad we picked $T$ for dinner!####5
I love $T$ and at Ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!####1
We shared the family platter and I especially enjoyed the $T$.####1
I ended the meal with the unusual $T$....yummy!####1
And the $T$ was simply spendid - quite a delight.####2

This is the case at this gem.####5
Best Neighborhood $T$.####5
You Can't Go Wrong Here.####5
In Grammercy/Union Square/East Village this is my neighbors and my favorite $T$.####5
The $T$ is great, no night better or worse, the bar tenders are generous with the pouring, and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits.####4

– I decided to eat at Stack because of their $T$.####3
When I walked in, I was taken aback by their incredible $T$.####4
The $T$ playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop $T$, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.####4

I got the $T$ and it was alright.####1
It wasn't the freshest $T$ ever, but the taste and presentation was OK.####1
I picked the $T$, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.####1
The $T$ came next and it tasted great, at least initially.####1
The $T$ was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.####1
It?s served with either a $T$ or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.####1
It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or $T$, though both were indistinguishable in taste.####1
Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the $T$.####1
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.####1
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.####1
The $T$ was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.####1

Just remember to dress a little urban-chic so you don?t look too far out of place.####5

I've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the $T$ very friendly.####2
They aren't the most talkative, but everytime I've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.####2

Delectable ####1
It's a tiny $T$ so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (Thurs?Sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.####5
Once you're inside, the real experience begins.####5
Everything, and I mean everything on the $T$ is delectable.####1
The $T$ are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.####2
The $T$ is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!####1

The $T$ itself is not exactly the best I've had EVER, but still pretty good.####1
I probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz I don't know if it's worth it.####5
Maybe I'll go back once more many years from now when I've forgotten I went there already.####5

I have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the $T$ which was odd.####5
The $T$ itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.####5
I felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom.####5

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at $T$ last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.####5
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous $T$, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.####4
Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the $T$ are only the third-best thing about Ray's!####4

To start things off, our lovely server $T$ was quickly on hand to take my drink order.####2
My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous $T$, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.####1

Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.####5
All considered, I have to say that $T$ is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.####5
