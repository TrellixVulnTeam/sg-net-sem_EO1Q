## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Instructions
You can run the model with the script *run_squad.sh* and *run_race.sh*.

We upload the processed example data in *data* folder which is annotated by our dependency labeler for quick practice. 

The labeler model is the [HPSG-Neural-Parser](https://github.com/DoodleJZ/HPSG-Neural-Parser). The implementation for this work will be publicly available soon.
